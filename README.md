# 2. Method
  At first, we had to download Laragon and Runaragon in order to log in to Wordpress. Once successfully logged in, it will open Wordpress for us. There won't be much there. Everything we want to do or need we have to download ourselves. Can be downloaded within Wordpress The first thing we need to do is our website page. In making website pages, we have 2 routes to choose from. First, design it yourself. Second, find someone else's theme and turn it into your website page. I chose to find someone else's theme to use. I chose the Shope theme version 1.0.1 by SwiftStore on their website page. His theme is selling clothes. and choose a theme to change to make a website selling veils We have chosen a theme and the next step is to decorate our website. What do you want it to be like? Whatever you want, we can do as we want. We finished decorating everything. We have to put in the products we want and set the right price. Next we will add the plugin. First we need to explain what a plugin is. Plugins are WordPress extensions in the form of scripts that improve performance. and expand the ability to make a simple website into a complete website More suitable for use for each purpose
